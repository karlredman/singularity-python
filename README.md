# Singularity Python

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/singularityware/singularity-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/singularityware/singularity-python)

Singularity Python is a python module and command line tool for working with <a href="https://singularityware.github.io" target="_blank">Singularity</a> containers, specifically providing functions to visualize, package, and compare containers. Currently, most functions use Singularity on the command line, and some require sudo.

We currently require Python > version 3 to use various timezone functions. If you are unable to install version 3.0, we provide a [Singularity.container](Singularity.container) for you to use instead. This is the recommended approach as some older versions of Python do not support generation of the timestamp. See the [installation docs](https://github.com/singularityware/singularity-python/wiki/Installation) for your different options.
