# Generation

The cirros and busybox images were produced with Singularity 2.4, which has a much smaller image footprint. The file extractions for the package are from 2016, and were remade as one had become corrupt. More evidence for squashfs

```
sudo singularity build cirros-2017-10-21.simg docker://cirros
sudo singularity build busybox-2017-10-21.simg docker://busybox

```
